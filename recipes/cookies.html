    <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture.

    But the most important thing to note about this recipe is that it makes a lot of cookies (six dozen to be exact!). This makes it an ideal recipe to whip up if you're baking for a large group, but not the best option if you're baking for just a few people. That said, you can pre-scoop the cookie dough onto a sheet tray, freeze the dough balls, then transfer them into zip-top bags and stash them in the freezer for later.</p>
